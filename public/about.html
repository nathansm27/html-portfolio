<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Nathan Stowe-Morgans</strong>. I have been working in Sales for over 10 years but have always had a love for technology and understanding how it works. This has led me to start a journey of coding. Whilst I am incredible new, I can already tell I made the best decision getting started.</p> 

<p>You will find across my portofolio a number of different projects which I am working on to fine tune my skills.</p>
